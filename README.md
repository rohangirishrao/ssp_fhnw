Repository for the course Sensors and Signal Processing at FHNW for the Master Biomedical Engineering in the 2nd Semester.

This will contain a notebook that was used to process the signal of a magnetometer located inside a Helmholtz coil and subsequently inside a spiral coil placed on a coordinate grid.
A tracking algorithm was used to then calculate the position of the smartphone from the magnetometer data. The repository also holds a scientific paper that describes the experiments and results.
